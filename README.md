# AIDD Coding Foundations

This repository records my two-week intensive training on Python data structures 
(List, Dict, Set, Stack) and basic algorithms, motivated by applications in 
AI-driven Drug Design (AIDD).

## Motivation

As a chemistry / drug design student transitioning into AIDD, my main bottleneck 
is not model usage but low-level coding fluency and data structure thinking.
This project aims to build "muscle memory" for:

- Array / Hash Table (molecule indexing, fingerprint lookup)
- String / Stack (SMILES parsing, substructure matching)
- Two-pointer / Sliding window (trajectory and sequence analysis)

## Structure

- week1_array_hash:  
  Array, hash table, duplicate removal, frequency counting  
- week2_string_stack:  
  String parsing, stack, prefix matching, palindrome, substring search  
- notes:  
  Personal cheat sheets and pattern summaries  

Each problem is implemented in two versions:
1. Brute-force baseline  
2. Optimized data-structure-based solution  

With detailed comments and AIDD analogies.

## Goal

After two weeks, I should be able to:
- Write Python data processing logic without relying on AI autocomplete
- Instantly choose appropriate data structures
- Translate algorithmic patterns to cheminformatics pipelines
